#### Solid  Principles
#### Design Patterns  (oops + Solid principles)

*Most used*
- Factory 
- Abstract Factory
- singletion
- observer

*Recommended*
- Builder
- Decorator
- adapter
- strategy
- facade

#### Class Diagram
	- able to expalin reationship of classes (has/is instance), liftime of class, abstract classes which to make, multiplicty (1:n)
#### follow uml convention (seggeration or composition)
#### Sequence or useCaseDiagram (very rare to ask)
#### Test Cases
#### Multithreading

ex: hotel management, car parking, lift management, chess desing, tic tac toe, ticket booking, atm

#### Time management
#### chess, tic tac toe => focus more on coding
#### swiggy, ola => focus on requirement gathering

#### uml diagram expectation => data members, functions, relationships


#### Approach;
- Identify actor
- Start visuzaling what actor is doing (help in requirements, uml, - writing code)
- Note down requirements
- UML
- Design pattern decisions (factory, singletion, observer, staratergy -> takes less amount to code)
- Code  (try to code most important module if code is less)
- Design decisions with interviewer  (tradeoff b/w design decisions)
- Revise Dsa basics (may be we can some datastructure like trees)
- mention trade-offs
- practice on white board
